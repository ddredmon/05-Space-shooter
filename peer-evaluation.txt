What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

I learned about making better docstrings by also including descriptions for
each of the parameters.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply
to your own programming projects?

I think the documentation was well done, and will be sure to include more
details in my docstrings in the future. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

I would recommend to also kill() bullets that have left the screen, just to
save on memory. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

The comments were very well done, nothing wrong to point out. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

Nope, the comments helped describe what everything was doing. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes. 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more
descriptive?

Could talk more about any particular mechanics, or how the player can move
their character. The README acts as a synopsis for the game, but since it's
GitHub, you could also go into more technical attributes. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Well commented and organized. Easy to read.
